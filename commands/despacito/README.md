# despacito.js

this part is a complete mess. it's also the first *proper* command for slabbot.

a random video is selected from a predetermined list, and then is sent as an embed.
this can be triggered by sending `slabbot despacito` or `this is so sad play despacito`.

you can also get a specific video by specifying a number after the command (e.g. `slabbot despacito 14`.)
