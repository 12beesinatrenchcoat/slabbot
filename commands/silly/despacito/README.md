# commands/sillly/**despacito**

~~this command is a complete mess.~~ it was also the first *proper* command for slabbot (that i admittedly stole from an older project, [`despacitoBot;`](https://github.com/AndyThePie/despacitoBot-semicolon)).  
the reason it gets its own folder is because i split the list of videos and creators into their own file.

a random video is selected from a predetermined list, and then is sent as an embed. (a youtube playlist containing all the videos can be found [here](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLchhjXy0uG8pfrYkYFwG_IwnoR0PozqJs).)  
this command can be triggered by sending `slabbot despacito` or `this is so sad play despacito`.

you can also get a specific video by specifying a number after the command (e.g. `slabbot despacito 14`.)
