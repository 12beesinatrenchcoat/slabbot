commit `tba` / 9 Jul 2020
what's that? a wild **slabbot** attacks!

another new discord bot. originally going to be a fork of [despacitoBot;](https://github.com/AndyThePie/despacitoBot-semicolon) but I disliked the old codebase too much. so here's this. built from the ground up using the [Akairo](https://discord-akairo.github.io/) framework for [discord.js](https://discord.js.org).
the bot is far from done, but... i wanted to get *something* done. so... here's something.

### + additions +
+ the basic commands - ping / about. 
  + ping can be executed using `slabbot ping`
  + about can be executed using `slabbot about`
+ this is so sad play despacito. stolen from despacitoBot, and then rewritten. gives a random despacito-related video using an embed.
  + executed using `this is so sad play despacito` (case insenstive) or `slabbot despacito`.

yeah, that's about it.

### things to do:

- [ ] create `slabbot help` - in case people need to know commands.
- [ ] categorize commands, maybe
- [ ] create some owner-related commands for rebooting / shutdown / reloading / etc
- [ ] a website or something
- [ ] sql stuff to track command usage
