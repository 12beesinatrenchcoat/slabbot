a poorly coded and experimental discord bot with weird features that no one ever asked for.

powered by [**discord.js**](https://github.com/discordjs/discord.js) and [**akairo**](https://github.com/discord-akairo/discord-akairo).

## features!!

`this is so sad play despacito` - despacito-related videos. (not automatic, picked from a list)

more to come...



## hey, isn't this just despacitobot?
yes, it is.  i revived it and added more features. i've also rewritten parts of it, and at this point, i don't think it's really the same thing. well, not at the time of writing this, though - it's still basically a clone of despacitoBot.

despacitoBot will remain under the Unlicense, and can still be found [here](https://github.com/AndyThePie/despacitobot-semicolon).
